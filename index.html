            <p>The Royal python (Python regius), also called the ball python, is a python species native to West and
                Central Africa, where it lives in grasslands and shrublands. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN
                Red List because of its wide distribution. It is threatened by hunting for its meat and for the
                international pet trade.[1] This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing
                to a maximum length of 182 cm (72 in).[2] The name "ball python" refers to its tendency to curl into a
                ball when stressed or frightened

                The diet of the ball python in the wild consists mostly of small mammals such as Natal multimammate
                mouse, shrews, gerbils, and striped mice, and birds. Young pythons less than 70 cm (28 in) total length
                and males prey almost exclusively on small bird nestlings and immature young. Pythons greater than 70 cm
                total length and females prey almost exclusively on small mammals.

            Females are oviparous and lay three to 11 rather large, leathery eggs.[7] They incubate them underground
            with a shivering motion. They hatch after 55 to 60 days. Young male pythons reach sexual maturity at 11–18
            months, and females at 20–36 months. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and the ability
            to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at 600 g (21 oz) or more, but in captivity are often not
            bred until they are 800 g (28 oz), although in captivity, some males have been known to begin breeding at
            300–400 g (11–14 oz). Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g (28 oz) though 1,200 g (42 oz) or
            more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than 1,500 g (53
            oz). Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for
            themselves.
